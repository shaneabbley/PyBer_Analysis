# PyBer_Analysis
### Background
We were tasked with comparing ride share data, from the rideshare company PyBer, between areas with differing population densities. That is, using python, jupyter notebooks, pandas, and matplotlib, we determined how the average fares differed in urban, suburban, and rural areas. We visualized this data with a multiple line chart to help convince the CEO to make several changes to address disparities in different areas.
### Results

Unsurprisingly, significantly more rides occurred in urban areas, and thus there are many more drivers in the urban areas. Approximately, 10 times more rides occured in urban areas compared to rural areas, although there are 30 times more drivers in urban areas. Urban areas generated more revenue total, less per ride, and less per ride per driver. In all of these cases the suburbs lie nearly exactly between the urban and rural areas. The average fare per driver in a rural area is approximately 3 times greater than the average fare per driver in an urban area.
### Analysis and the Path Forward
With this data we can recommend three things. First, there appears to be a lack of retention among drivers. In this several month time frame, we observe that there were more drivers in urban areas than there were rides completed. In order to solve this, further incentives ought to be given to urban drivers. The next issue is similarly the overabundance of drivers compared to rides in both suburban and rural areas. Although less extreme compared to the urban drivers, this is still an illogical ratio. To solve this fares in these areas may need to be artificially lowered. Lastly, it makes sense to increase retention among drivers in all population densities. The best way to accomplish this would be to improve marketing to get more people to utilize the abundance of drivers.
